Our project is to create an Inventory Management System for a clothing store. The system will help manage inventory, sales, and supplier information easily. We plan to create a user-friendly interface by using object-oriented programming to make inventory tracking more efficient.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0376fec6-ec72-4584-b4ff-f72fd87f903c)
